## 1. Start project
With command "npm init -y".

## 2. Install express package
With command "npm i express".

## 3. Create backend folder
With command "mkdir backend"
Recomendation: You can begin either with the front-end or back-end, it's up to you... but it's recommended to start with the back-end so when the front-end starts beign elaborated it communicates with the already developed back-end. (a lot of "back's", read carefully).

## 4. Create server.js file
Move to the backend folder, with command "cd backend".
Create main .js file, with command "touch server.js".
This will be the main .js file for the project.

## 5. Initialize GIT
With command "git init".
Git will help by versioning your projects based on stages / steps.
Remember to add .gitignore file with node_modules folder's name in it to prevent the push of the node_modules folder to your repository.
With command "touch .gitignore".
Adding "node_modules" to the first line.
